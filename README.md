# Customer Sentiment Analysis: British Airways
Customer sentiment plays a pivotal role in the success of any modern business. However, deciphering customer sentiment requires sophisticated tools. In this in-depth exploratory analysis, I delve into airline customer review data for British Airways sourced from Kaggle.com. The goal is to interpret, clean, and transform raw data into actionable insights, ultimately aiming to enhance customer relations and retention.

## Project Overview
This comprehensive analysis covers a diverse array of customer experiences and focuses on transforming those experiences into valuable insights for improving the customer experience. This project spans across 3,500 distinct reviews with a main goal of identifying areas of focus that British Airways could work to improve customer relations.

## Tools and Methodology
For this project, I leverage Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The sentiment analysis is conducted using Vader, a natural language processor, to gauge the positive and negative polarity of each customer review. Additionally, scipy is employed for rigorous correlation testing and confidence interval analysis. To enhance the geographical context, airport code data is transformed into locations through web scraping from NationsOnline.org.
