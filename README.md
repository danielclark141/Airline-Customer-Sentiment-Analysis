# Airline-Customer-Sentiment-Analysis

Customer perception is a critical component of any business operating in our world today. But, discerning customer perception can be very difficult without the right tools. In this analysis, I perform a deep-dive exploratory analysis into airline customer review data for British Airways found on Kaggle.com  to interpret, clean, and transform raw data into insights that could be used to improve customer relations and retention. 

For this project, I chose to use Python's Pandas library and Vader natural language processor to interpret the positive and negative polarity of each review. I also utilize aditional tools such as scipy for testing correlation and confidence interval testing and webscrapping to transform airport code data into locations.
