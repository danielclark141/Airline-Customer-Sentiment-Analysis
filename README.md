# Customer Perception Analysis for British Airways
Customer perception plays a pivotal role in the success of any modern business. However, deciphering customer sentiment requires sophisticated tools. In this in-depth exploratory analysis, I delve into airline customer review data for British Airways sourced from Kaggle.com. The goal is to interpret, clean, and transform raw data into actionable insights, ultimately aiming to enhance customer relations and retention.

## Project Overview
This comprehensive analysis focuses on a sizable dataset from Kaggle.com, encompassing a wealth of customer reviews for British Airways. Covering a diverse range of customer experiences, this project spans [insert details about the dataset, e.g., time period covered, number of reviews, etc.]. The objective is to glean meaningful patterns and sentiments from the data, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Tools and Methodology
For this project, I leverage Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The sentiment analysis is conducted using Vader, a natural language processor, to gauge the positive and negative polarity of each customer review. Additionally, scipy is employed for rigorous correlation testing and confidence interval analysis. To enhance the geographical context, airport code data is transformed into locations through web scraping from NationsOnline.org.
